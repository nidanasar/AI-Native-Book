# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This interactive textbook will guide you through the fundamentals of building and simulating humanoid robots using ROS2 and Digital Twin technologies.

:::info What You'll Learn
By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Build robot software using ROS2's node-based architecture
- Understand how robots communicate through topics, services, and actions
- Create URDF models for humanoid robots
- Simulate robots safely using Digital Twins
- Use Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization
:::

## Course Overview

### Module 1: ROS2 Fundamentals

Learn how ROS2 acts as a robot's "nervous system" — coordinating communication between sensors, processors, and actuators.

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Introduction to ROS2 | Middleware, nervous system analogy, architecture |
| 2 | Nodes, Topics & Services | Communication patterns, message passing |
| 3 | Python & rclpy | Python integration, building nodes |
| 4 | URDF for Humanoids | Robot modeling, joint definitions |

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation

Build virtual replicas of your robot for safe testing and rapid development.

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Digital Twins | Virtual rehearsal, sim-to-real gap |
| 2 | Physics Simulation | Gazebo, rigid body dynamics |
| 3 | Sensor Simulation | Virtual cameras, IMUs, force sensors |
| 4 | Unity Visualization | High-fidelity rendering, HRI |

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- **Basic Python programming knowledge** — variables, functions, classes
- **Familiarity with the command line** — navigating directories, running commands
- **Understanding of basic robotics concepts** — helpful but not required

No prior ROS2 experience is needed — we'll teach you everything from the ground up.

## How to Navigate

Use the **sidebar** on the left to navigate through modules. Chapters are designed to be read sequentially, as each builds on previous concepts.

**Recommended learning path:**
1. Start with Module 1, Chapter 1 to understand ROS2 fundamentals
2. Progress through each chapter in order
3. Complete Module 1 before starting Module 2
4. Use the AI assistant for help at any time
